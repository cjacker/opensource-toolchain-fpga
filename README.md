# OpenSource toolchain for FGPA

A **field-programmable gate array (FPGA)** is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing â€“ hence the term field-programmable.

FPGA is not a CPU or MCU or special-purpose IC whose configuration is set and sealed by a manufacturer and cannot be modified, it's a general purpose IC that can be programmed (configured) for specific use after it has been manufactured. FPGA contain adaptive logic modules (ALMs) and logic elements (LEs) connected via programmable interconnects. These blocks create a physical array of logic gates that can be customized to perform specific computing tasks. 

FPGA programming is not like "programming" in the usual sense, such as C programming. FPGA programming is "creating hardware architecture to perform specific tasks". that's to say, by FPGA programming, you can config FPGA working as a CPU or as a hardware accelerator of specific algorithm.

And the programming language used with FPGA is far different from various programming languages we are already similar with. to program FPGAs, you use specific hardware description languages such as VHDL or Verilog, it describes the structure and behavior of electronic circuits, and most commonly, digital logic circuits.
